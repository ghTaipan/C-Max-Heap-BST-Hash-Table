# C++-Max-Heap-BST-Hash-Table
C++ codes for max heap, bst , hash table.

utils.hpp files do not belong to me. They were given as source code.

You can build the project (i.e. create the executable) using the following commands:

cd path/to/maxHeap # This should be the path to exercise1 in your system
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
Once you build the project, you can run the executable with desired inputs:
src/maxHeap ../data/only3/scores.csv 2
